# Flower_image_classification
Automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a flower’s species from a photo

DOMAIN: Botanical research
CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of
flowers. They already have have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can
create a classifier capable of determining a flower’s species from a photo
DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 17 plant species.

Steps and tasks: [ Total Score: 25 points]
1. Import the data. Analyse the dimensions of the data.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Data visualisation:
• Display the images
• Display the labels
• Display images vs labels
• Apply different filters [ for example: blur, contour, edge detection, emboss, smooth etc.] on the images and
display the image.
4. Train tune and test AIML image classifier model using:
• Use supervised learning algorithms for training
• Use neural networks for training
• Use CNN for training
• Use various CNN with transferred learning models for training
• Compare the results from the above step along with your detailed observations.
5. Create a GUI to import the image “Prediction.jpg” and use the above designed AIML image classification model to
predict the class/label of this image.
